# Chrome Web Store Description

Yet another tab manager: group, move, delete, sort, pin tabs

You can search the selection by entering keywords into the field.
Example: cat woman, superman, batman = ('cat' AND 'woman') OR ('superman') OR ('batman')

If only one tab is selected, press Enter to focus this tab.

Actions like "extract" apply to the whole selection unless there are checked tabs, in which case they apply to the subselection.

You can move tabs by dragging the "xx tabs" icon in the toolbar to a new position in the left panel. The selected tabs will be inserted before the tab you dropped the selection on.

You can doubleclick a tab in the left panel to focus this tab.

You can click a window in the left panel to focus this window.

At the bottom right of chrome://extensions/ you can assign a keyboard shortcut to Top Tomato.
